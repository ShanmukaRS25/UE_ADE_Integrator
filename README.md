## 🚀 Introduction

**UnrealMCP** is an open-source plugin that integrates the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** into Unreal Engine 5.5. It functions as a bridge, allowing external AI agents (like Claude, ChatGPT, or custom LLMs) to interact directly with the Unreal Editor.

This project enables AI to:
*   **Inspect and Query** the current level and assets.
*   **Manipulate Actors** (Spawn, Move, Delete).
*   **Generate and Modify Blueprints** programmatically.
*   **Edit Blueprint Graphs** by adding nodes, connections, and variables.

By standardizing the communication protocol, UnrealMCP opens the door for advanced AI-assisted game development workflows, automated testing, and intelligent editor tools.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **TCP Socket Server**: Robust, non-blocking server running within the Unreal Editor to handle MCP requests.
*   **Extensible Command System**: Modular architecture allowing easy addition of new commands.
*   **Direct Editor Manipulation**:
    *   Spawn and control actors.
    *   Query level data and object properties.
*   **Blueprint Automation**:
    *   Create new Blueprint assets.
    *   Add components and variables.
    *   Compile Blueprints remotely.
*   **Graph Editing**:
    *   Add nodes, events, and function calls to Blueprint graphs.
    *   Connect pins and structure logic flows.

## 🏗 Architecture & MCP Integration

UnrealMCP works by running a **TCP Server** inside the Unreal Editor via `UEpicUnrealMCPBridge`, which is an `UEditorSubsystem`. This ensures the server starts automatically when the editor launches and runs on the main game thread (via `AsyncTask` for thread safety) to interact with the Unreal API.

### How it works:
1.  **Server Start**: `UEpicUnrealMCPBridge` initializes a TCP listener on port **55557** (default).
2.  **Connection**: An external MCP client connects to `localhost:55557`.
3.  **Command Handling**: JSON-formatted commands are received and routed to specific handlers:
    *   `FEpicUnrealMCPEditorCommands`: Handles level and actor operations.
    *   `FEpicUnrealMCPBlueprintCommands`: Handles Blueprint asset creation and modification.
    *   `FEpicUnrealMCPBlueprintGraphCommands`: Handles low-level graph editing (nodes, pins).
4.  **Execution**: Commands are executed on the Game Thread to ensure thread safety with Unreal's garbage collection and object management.
5.  **Response**: The result (or error) is sent back to the client as a JSON response.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Unreal Engine 5.5** or later.
*   **Visual Studio 2022** (for C++ compilation).
*   **Git** (optional, for cloning).


## 🛠 MCP Tools & Commands

UnrealMCP exposes a wide range of tools to external agents. Commands are sent as JSON objects with a `command` field and a `parameters` object.

### 🏠 Editor & Level Commands
| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `get_actors_in_level` | List all actors in the current level. |
| `find_actors_by_name` | Find specific actors by their name or label. |
| `spawn_actor` | Spawn a standard actor (e.g., StaticMesh, Light). |
| `delete_actor` | Remove an actor from the level. |
| `set_actor_transform` | Move, rotate, or scale an actor. |
| `spawn_blueprint_actor` | Spawn an instance of a Blueprint asset. |

### 📘 Blueprint Asset Commands
| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `create_blueprint` | Create a new Blueprint asset. |
| `add_component_to_blueprint` | Add a component (Mesh, Light, etc.) to a BP. |
| `compile_blueprint` | Compile a Blueprint to apply changes. |
| `set_physics_properties` | Modify physics settings of a component. |
| `set_static_mesh_properties` | Set the mesh asset for a StaticMeshComponent. |
| `get_blueprint_variable_details` | Inspect variables within a Blueprint. |
| `analyze_blueprint_graph` | Analyze the structure of a Blueprint graph. |

### 🕸 Blueprint Graph Commands
| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `add_blueprint_node` | Add a generic node to the graph. |
| `connect_nodes` | Connect two pins together. |
| `create_variable` | Create a new variable in the Blueprint. |
| `add_event_node` | Add an event node (e.g., BeginPlay). |
| `create_function` | Create a new function within the Blueprint. |
| `set_node_property` | Modify properties of a graph node. |
